# Mobee film database
Android app for showing several views and functionalities of a film database. Done for the Interaction and Interface Design (IDI) subject at the Barcelona School of Informatics (FIB - UPC)

## Branches
Branches from master should serve to implement one of the tasks specified by the assignment, with the prefixes `erikkvam`, `jbpextra` or `common` used to differentiate between each of the sections.

Common branches are to be `common-about` and `common-help` for the *About* and *Help* sections, and `common-consistency` for any changes related to consistency of the app (such as color, style, language...)

## Name and color
The app is *Mobee* as in merging *movie* and *bee*. Bees because of the app working hard to provide you sweet honey and such.

Main color is, by association, yellow. Also because yellow is the most related movie color that could be found (golden globes, oscars, awards, 20th Century Fox, IMDb, Rotten Tomatos...)

Accent color is blue because of the triadic connection with yellow.
